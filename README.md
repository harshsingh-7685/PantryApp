# Pantry Android App
This is a simple Android project designed to keep track of pantry items. The app allows users to add, update, and view pantry items with details like name, quantity, and expiration date.

## Features
* __SQLite Integration__: Data persistance for pantry items.
* __UI Components__: A basic user interface with ListView for displaying the items in the pantry.
* __CRUD Operations__: Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for each item in the pantry.
* __Fragements and Navigation__: Uses fragments for navigation between screens.

## Current State
__Status__: This project is not fully functional and crashes during use. The basic code structure and components have been implemented, but other issues are preventing the app from running as intended.

## Disclaimer
This project was initially created as a learning exercise and was adapted from a YouTube tutorial. The codebase serves as a foundation for my understanding of basic Android app development, but it does not represent an original or production-ready implementation.

## Future Implementations
* Fix crashes and ensure the app runs correctly.
* Improve UI
* Enchance error handling.
* Implement testing for all features of the app.
